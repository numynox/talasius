We are aware that the celebration in Italy causes CO₂ emissions. To help reduce our footprint, we want to assist you in finding the most efficient travel options and connecting you with other guests to travel together.

## By train

For our guests traveling from or through Germany, there are three convenient options to reach Brescia and Lake Iseo by train.

*   **Munich to Verona:** A direct [Railjet RJ8X/EC8X](https://www.oebb.at/en/reiseplanung-services/im-zug/unsere-zuege/railjet) departing from Munich every two hours and arriving in Verona Porta Nuova, operated by ÖBB. From Verona, you can take a Trenitalia high-speed or local train to Brescia.
*   **Frankfurt to Milan:** A direct [Eurocity Express ECE151](https://www.zugreiseblog.de/zug-frankfurt-mailand/) departing daily at 08:02 from Frankfurt Hbf and arriving at 15:35 in Milano Centrale, operated by SBB. From Milan, you can take a Trenitalia high-speed or local train to Brescia.
*  The direct [ÖBB Nightjet](https://www.nightjet.com/en/reiseziele/) connection from Munich to Brescia will unfortunately not be in service in 2026 due to construction work. However, you can take the night train from **Munich to Venice** and visit the city before continuing to Brescia with a Trenitalia High-Speed train.

To get the cheapest tickets, we recommend checking [DB](https://int.bahn.de/en?dbkanal_007=sprachauswahl-en), [ÖBB](https://www.oebb.at/en), and [Trenitalia](https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html) for all connections, as well as [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en) for the Frankfurt connection. You may need to book two separate tickets (e.g. Erlangen to Verona with DB and Verona to Brescia with Trenitalia, or Erlangen to Munich with DB and Munich to Brescia with ÖBB). Regional trains in Italy can be purchased through Trenitalia or directly at the station. They are not expensive, and the price does not change if purchased on the day of travel.

## By plane

If you choose to travel by plane, we suggest one of the following airports.

*   **Bergamo Airport (BGY):** Also misleadingly called "Milan Bergamo". It is the closest airport, located about **40 minutes** by car from Iseo or Brescia. It is served mostly by low-cost airlines like Ryanair. There is a direct airport bus to Brescia ([option 1](https://www.airportbusexpress.it/en-GB/bus-stop-timetable/bresciaautostazione-orioalserio) or [option 2](https://autostradale.it/en/i-nostri-servizi/transfer-aeroportuali/brescia-autostazione-bergamo-orio-al-serio/)).
*   **Milan Linate (LIN):** About **60 minutes** by car from Iseo or Brescia. It is served by standard airlines like Lufthansa or Air Dolomiti. If you are traveling by public transport, you can easily reach Milano Centrale main station by metro or bus. From there, continue by train to Brescia.
*   **Milan Malpensa (MXP):** About **90 minutes** by car from Iseo or Brescia, also served by standard airlines. If you are traveling by public transport, you can reach Milano Centrale main station by train or bus in 60 minutes. From there, continue by train to Brescia. This is logistically the least comfortable airport option.

Verona Airport (VRN) mostly offers regional flights only.

## Traveling together

Traveling together is not only more environmentally friendly but also more fun! If you are interested in carpooling or traveling in groups, please let us know in your RSVP. We will add you to a WhatsApp group where you can coordinate with other guests.

## Getting to the venue

To reach the wedding venue, we recommend the following options.

*   **Car:** A car is the most convenient way to reach the venue. Rental cars are available at all airports and in Brescia.
*   **Carpooling:** If you prefer not to rent a car, please let us know in the RSVP. We can put you in touch with guests who have free seats in their car. Likewise, if you have a car and can offer a ride, please let us know.
*   **Train:** It is possible to reach the venue by train from Brescia, but please note that the **last train back departs at 8:00 PM**, while the party will continue for longer.
*   **Taxi:** We **do not recommend** relying on taxis to get to or from the venue, as they can be unreliable even from nearby towns like Pisogne.
