**Answer:** Castello di Brescia

The Castello di Brescia sits on a hill overlooking the city and is known as "The Falcon of Italy". The castle dates back to medieval times and offers a wonderful view over the rooftops of Brescia. The walk up the winding paths is quite scenic, and you can enjoy beautiful sunsets from one of the towers.
