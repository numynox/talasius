**Answer:** Monte Maddalena

Monte Maddalena is Brescia's local mountain and can be reached via the Via Panoramica with 13 hairpin bends or by bus line 6. The ascent gains nearly 700 meters of elevation. From the summit, on clear days, you have a fantastic view as far as Lake Garda to the east and Monte Rosa to the west. You also get a direct view of the marble works of Botticino. There is a [pleasant circular hike](../../activities/hikes/#monte-maddalena) or you can just take a short walk and enjoy the view.
