**Answer:** Piazza della Loggia

Piazza della Loggia is one of the most beautiful squares in Brescia and clearly shows Venetian influence. The impressive clock tower and Renaissance architecture recall the time when Brescia was under Venetian rule. The square is a popular meeting point and ideal for enjoying a coffee or Pirlo at one of the cafés.
