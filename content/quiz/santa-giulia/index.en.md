**Answer:** A former monastery

The Santa Giulia Museum is housed in a historic monastery and tells the story of Brescia from pre-Roman times to the present day. Highlights include the mosaics of the Domus Ortaglia (an old Roman house) and the treasures of the Lombards. The museum is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site and regularly hosts changing art exhibitions.
