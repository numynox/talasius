**Answer:** It has a circular floor plan

The Duomo Vecchio (Old Cathedral) in Brescia is one of the few Romanesque cathedrals in Italy with a circular floor plan. It stands directly next to the neoclassical Duomo Nuovo (New Cathedral) at Piazza Paolo VI. Fun fact: In 1512, young Niccolò Tartaglia was injured here with a knife, which led to his speech impediment – this is where the Italian word "tartagliare" (to stutter) comes from.
