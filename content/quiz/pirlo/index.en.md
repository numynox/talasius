**Answer:** Pirlo

The Pirlo is the local version of the Spritz, but is typically made with still white wine instead of Prosecco. The word "Pirlo" has two possible meanings: _curl_ (when the red Campari is poured into the glass and forms a spiral) or _fall_ (when someone has had too much of it). The Pirlo is the perfect drink for an afternoon break in one of Brescia's beautiful squares.
