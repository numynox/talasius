There is a broad range of accommodation options available at Lake Iseo and in Brescia, depending on your preference. Here are our recommendations.

## Staying at Lake Iseo

If you prefer to stay close to the venue and enjoy the lake atmosphere, we recommend looking for hotels in **Pisogne**, **Marone**, or **Sale Marasino**. The town of **Iseo** itself offers even more choices and a lively promenade.

## Staying in Brescia

If you want to stay longer and have a central base for exploring various places between Lake Iseo and Lake Garda, we recommend staying in **Brescia**.

*   **Location:** Any hotel in the city center between *Via Pusterla* and *Via Vittorio Emanuele II*, or along *Via Crocifissa di Rosa* is a good choice.
*   **Connections:** Brescia is well connected by train to Milan, the southern part of Lake Garda, Verona, Venice, and Turin.
*   **Access by car:** The [city center of Brescia](https://www.bresciamobilita.it/map#/mode=busRoutes/poitypes=ztlentrance,ztlarea/date=07-12-2025/direction=0/) cannot be accessed by car, unless your accommodation provides parking and registers your license plate for access to the city center. The restricted area is called **ZTL** (Zona di Traffico Limitato) and "ZTL attiva / ZTL closed" means you are not allowed to enter without registration.

## Other Options

*   **Combined Stay:** A combination of staying a few nights at the lake in Iseo and a few nights in Brescia is also a great way to experience the region.
*   **Bergamo and Milan:** While Bergamo and Milan are beautiful cities to visit, we do not recommend them for accommodation due to logistics, unless you need to stay very close to one of the airports for an early flight.
