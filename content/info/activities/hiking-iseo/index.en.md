Discover the most beautiful hiking trails around Lake Iseo. From easy strolls along the shore to challenging mountain tours, the region offers something for every taste. Enjoy breathtaking views of the lake and the surrounding landscape.

A special highlight is the hike to Monte Isola, the largest lake island in Europe. You can reach the island with a short ferry ride and explore various paths that lead you through picturesque villages, olive groves, and to impressive viewpoints. The circular path around the island is relatively flat and ideal for a relaxed day trip, while more challenging trails lead to the summit of Monte Isola, from where you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the lake and the Alps.

For those seeking a greater challenge, the surrounding mountains such as Monte Guglielmo or Corna Trentapassi offer demanding routes with spectacular panoramas. These paths often lead through untouched nature, past small chapels and alpine pastures, where you can experience the tranquility and beauty of the Lombard Prealps. Many hiking trails are well-marked and offer opportunities for refreshments in mountain huts or traditional trattorias, where you can sample local specialties. Don't forget to bring sturdy footwear and plenty of water.
