Brescia is a great starting point to visit some of Northern Italy's most famous cities. All of them are easily reachable by train.

## Bergamo
The **Città Alta** (Upper Town) is a medieval jewel surrounded by Venetian walls. Hop on the funicular to get up there and wander through its cobbled streets.

## Verona
Famous for **Romeo and Juliet**, but for us, the real highlight is the **Arena**, a remarkably preserved Roman amphitheater still used for opera today.

## Milan
Italy's fashion and finance capital. Must-sees include the magnificent **Duomo**, the **Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II**, and Leonardo da Vinci's *Last Supper* (remember to book months in advance!).

## Padova
Home to one of the world's oldest universities and the **Scrovegni Chapel**, featuring Giotto's masterpiece frescoes.

## Venice
The unique city on water needs no introduction. Get lost in its canals, visit **St. Mark's Square**, but we recommend exploring the quieter neighborhoods like *Cannaregio* to escape the crowds.
