Lake Garda is a huge destination with so much to offer. Here are our top activities for a day trip.

## Sirmione
The pearl of the lake. **Sirmione** is a stunning peninsula jutting out into the water.
*   **Grotte di Catullo:** You really shouldn't miss these impressive ruins of a Roman villa at the very tip of the peninsula. The views over the turquoise water are just incredible.
*   **The Castle:** The scaliger castle guarding the entry to the town is like something out of a fairytale.

## Rocca di Manerba
If you're into nature and history, the **Rocca di Manerba** is a must.
*   **The Park:** It's a protected nature reserve with trails leading up to the ruins of a medieval fortress on a cliff.
*   **The View:** The top offers one of the best panoramas of the lower lake and its islands.

## Boat Ride
The best way to see the lake is definitely from the water.
*   **From Peschiera del Garda:** Rent a small boat or take a ferry to explore the southern shores and the fortified walls of Peschiera.
*   **From Salò:** Take a boat from the elegant town of Salò to explore the western shore, known as the Riviera dei Limoni.
