Great news: Our wedding location is perfectly situated between two renowned wine regions: Franciacorta to the west and Lugana to the east.

## Franciacorta
The **Franciacorta** region, located south of Lake Iseo, is famous for its sparkling method champenoise wines. Think of it as Italy's answer to Champagne.
*   **What to do:** Visit a historic winery (cantina) for a tour and tasting. Famous names include *Berlucchi*, *Ca' del Bosco*, and *Bellavista*, but smaller family-run wineries often offer a more intimate experience.
*   **The Wine:** You have to try the *Franciacorta Satèn*, a silky, smooth sparkling wine unique to this region.

## Lugana
Located on the southern shores of Lake Garda, the **Lugana** region produces excellent white wines, primarily from the Turbiana grape.
*   **What to do:** Drive through the vineyards around Sirmione and Desenzano. Many wineries offer tastings without prior booking, so you can just drop by.
*   **The Wine:** Lugana is a fresh, mineral white wine that pairs perfectly with lake fish.
