If you love hiking, you're in the right place! Here are our favorite trails around the lakes.

## Lake Iseo

### 1. Corna Trentapassi
For the best view of Lake Iseo, you definitely need to head to **Corna Trentapassi**. It's a steep climb, but trust us, the 360-degree panorama from the top is absolutely worth it. You'll see the entire lake and Monte Isola directly below you.
*Tip: You can combine this hike with a walk around the [Piramidi di Zone](../iseo), impressive earth pyramids that are a really cool geological phenomenon.*

### 2. Monte Guglielmo
The giant of the lake. **Monte Guglielmo** (or "Gölem" as locals call it) is a long but rewarding hike. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the Apennines. There's a monument to the Redeemer and a refuge near the summit where you can grab a bite to eat.

### 3. Punta Almana
A fantastic ridge walk. **Punta Almana** offers spectacular views of the lake and the surrounding mountains. We particularly love the trail via the Forcella di Sale.

## Lake Garda

### 1. Monte Cas
A relatively easy hike with a stunning reward. **Monte Cas** offers a plunge-down view to the sanctuary of Montecastello and the lake below. It feels like you're flying over the water.

### 2. Tremosine
The area of **Tremosine** is a hiking paradise. There are tons of trails winding through the "Brivido Terrace" villages. The views down to the lake are dramatic and it's much more peaceful than the busy lakeside towns.

### 3. Cima Comer
For a great balcony over the lake, climb **Cima Comer**. It's near Gargnano and gives you a fantastic vantage point over the southern part of Lake Garda.
