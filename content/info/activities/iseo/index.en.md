Lake Iseo is often called Italy's hidden gem. Whatever you do, make sure you don't miss these highlights!

## Monte Isola
A trip to Lake Iseo isn't complete without a boat ride to **Monte Isola**, the largest lake island in Europe.
*   **The Hike:** Once you land (usually in Peschiera Maraglio), hike up to the **Santuario della Madonna della Ceriola** at the very top. It's the highest point on the island and offers one of the most beautiful panoramas of the lake.
*   **The Vibe:** No cars are allowed on the island (except for a few service vehicles), making it a peaceful haven to explore by bike or on foot.

## The Floating Piers
In 2016, the artist Christo created **The Floating Piers**, a temporary installation that allowed people to walk on water from Sulzano to Monte Isola and the island of San Paolo.
*   **Legacy:** While the installation is gone, the event put Lake Iseo on the world map. You can still see photos and souvenirs in local shops, and walking the same route by boat today gives you a sense of the scale of the project.

## Piramidi di Zone
For something truly unique, visit the **Piramidi di Zone**.
*   **What are they?** These are massive earth pillars topped with large boulders, created by erosion. They look like something straight out of a fantasy movie.
*   **Visit:** There is a well-marked circular trail that takes you through the reserve, offering various observation points to admire these geological giants.
