Brescia is often overlooked, but it's a lovely city with a lot to offer. Here is a small guide to our favorite places.

## Roman Brescia
A good place to start is **Via dei Musei**, where you can find the **Capitolium** and the **Roman Forum**. These are UNESCO World Heritage sites and give you a real sense of the city's ancient history. Inside the Capitolium, the statue of the Winged Victory is definitely worth seeing.

## The Falcon of Italy
If you don't mind a little walk, the **Castello di Brescia** is a great spot. Known as the "Falcon of Italy", it sits on a hill overlooking the town. The walk up winding paths is quite scenic, and once you are there, you are rewarded with a nice view over the city rooftops and the nearby vineyards. It is a peaceful place to watch the sunset.

## City Center
Back in the center, you can stroll through the main squares. **Piazza della Loggia** has a distinct Venetian feel with its clock tower. Nearby at **Piazza Paolo VI**, you'll find something quite unique: the Old and the New Duomo standing side by side.

## Culture
For museums, we recommend the **Santa Giulia Museum**. Housed in an ancient monastery, it tells the story of the city from pre-Roman times to the present day in a very engaging way.

## Essential Tip
When you want to take a break, try a **Pirlo**. It's the local take on the Spritz, but typically made with still white wine. Just find a table at a bar in one of the squares and enjoy the atmosphere.
