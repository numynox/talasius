Brescia is often overlooked, as it sits between Milan and Venice, but the Lioness of Italy is a lovely city with a lot to offer. Here is a small guide to our favorite places.

## Roman Brescia
A good place to start is the [**Via dei Musei**](https://www.bresciamusei.com/en/museums-and-venues/brixia-roman-archaeological-area/), where you can find the **Capitolium**, the **Roman Theatre** and the **Santa Giulia Museum**. These sites brought the UNESCO World Heritage acknowledgement to the city. The Roman ruins give you a sense of the city's ancient history, which was called _Brixia_ back then.

## The Falcon of Italy
If you don't mind a little walk, the **Castello di Brescia** is a great spot. Known as the "Falcon of Italy", it sits on a hill overlooking the town. The walk up winding paths is quite scenic, and once you are there, you are rewarded with a nice view over the city rooftops. You can enjoy the sunset from one of the towers. The way up can be shortened, as car parking is available right in front of the pedestrian access.

## City Center
Back in the center, you can stroll through the main squares. **Piazza della Loggia** has a distinct Venetian feel with its clock tower. Nearby at **Piazza Paolo VI**, you'll find something quite unique: the Old romanic Duomo, with an atypical circular outline, and the neoclassic New Duomo standing side by side.

## Culture
For museums, we recommend the [**Santa Giulia Museum**](https://www.bresciamusei.com/en/museums-and-venues/santa-giulia-museum/). Housed in a monastery, it tells the story of the city from pre-Roman times to the present day, with exhibitios changing every year. The mosaics of an old Roman house (Domus Ortaglia) and the treasure of the Langobards are probably the highlight of the permanent exhibit.

## Essential Tip
When you want to take an afternoon break, try a **Pirlo**. It's the local version of the Spritz, but typically made with still white wine. Just find a table at a bar in one of the squares and enjoy the atmosphere. Pirlo can be understood as 'curl', which can be seen when the Aperol or acampari get poured in the glass, or 'fall', which can be seen when someone enjoys it too much.
