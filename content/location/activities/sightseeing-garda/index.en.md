Discover the picturesque towns on the southern side of Lake Garda, including charming Sirmione with its Scaliger Castle and Roman ruins. Enjoy the beauty of the landscape and the rich history of the region.

Sirmione, often referred to as the "Pearl of Lake Garda," is an absolute must-see. The impressive 13th-century Scaliger Castle, situated directly on the water, offers a fascinating glimpse into medieval architecture and history. Stroll through the narrow streets of the old town, enjoy a gelato, and visit the Grottoes of Catullus, the remains of a Roman villa from the 1st century AD with spectacular views of the lake. Sirmione's thermal springs are also famous for their healing properties and invite you to relax.

In addition to Sirmione, there are other charming towns on the southern side of Lake Garda worth visiting. Peschiera del Garda, a fortress town that is a UNESCO World Heritage site, captivates with its canals and Venetian fortifications. Lazise and Bardolino are known for their beautiful lakeside promenades, lively markets, and excellent wines. Take a boat trip on the lake to admire the various towns from the water, or rent a bicycle and explore the flat lakeside paths that connect many of these towns. Everywhere you'll find cozy restaurants offering fresh fish and local specialties.
