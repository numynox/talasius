Explore the diverse hiking trails on the western and southern sides of Lake Garda. From relaxed lakeside strolls to challenging routes with panoramic views – here you'll find the perfect tour for your outdoor experience.

The western side of Lake Garda offers spectacular routes, often leading through olive groves and lemon gardens, with breathtaking views of the lake. A highlight is the Sentiero del Ponale, an old path that winds along the cliffs and was once an important connecting road. Today, it's a popular hiking and cycling trail starting from Riva del Garda, offering impressive panoramas. For more experienced hikers, a trip to Monte Baldo is recommended; although located on the eastern side, it's easily accessible from many points on the western side, with a cable car facilitating the ascent.

In the south of Lake Garda, the hikes are generally flatter and ideal for families or leisurely strolls. Discover the Sirmione peninsula with its Scaliger Castle and the Grottoes of Catullus, which you can explore on a pleasant walk. The morainic hills in the hinterland also offer gentle paths through vineyards and small villages, where you can sample local products and wines. Many of these paths are well-marked and offer opportunities for refreshments in charming trattorias.
