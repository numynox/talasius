## On the peaks of Lake Iseo

We enjoy spending our time in nature and love hiking in the mountains around Lake Iseo. Peaks like Punta Almana or Corna Trentapassi always offer spectacular views. We do not want to keep this special view of the lake and the relaxed atmosphere of the mountains to ourselves, but want to share this experience with you during our wedding celebration.

## El Dos del Bec
As a venue we chose the agriturismo ["El Dos del Bec"](https://www.eldosdelbec.com/), which is located on a green hill at the foot of the Corna Trentapassi in Toline. The property enjoys a panoramic view of Lake Iseo, thanks to its privileged position opposite Lovere and the gorge of Castro, with a glimpse of the Orobie alps, recognizable in winter by their snow-capped peaks.

The name translates to "the bump of the buck", where 'buck' is the male goat, recalling the farming tradition around the lake and throughout Val Camonica. The farm associated with the agriturismo currently raises various animals, including sheep, cattle, and alpacas, the latter chosen for their sustainability. In addition, the cultivation of olive trees, chestnuts, fruit trees, and many other varieties allows the agriturismo to create high-quality locally sourced dishes _("a chilometro zero")_ and menus that respect the seasonality of the products. El Dos del Bec will surprise you with delicious dishes typical for the lake and its mountains!

## Getting to the venue

The agriturismo can be reached comfortably from Brescia by car in about 40 minutes (60 minutes from Bergamo Airport). Sufficient parking spaces are available directly on site. Please note that the last meters to the location lead over a steep and relatively narrow road. Those who prefer to park their car down in the village of Toline can use a shuttle service for the last part (we will contact you for this at a later point).

If you prefer not to drive, please let us know in the RSVP. We can put you in touch with guests who have free seats in their car. Likewise, if you have a car and can offer a ride, please let us know.

There is also a train from Brescia to Toline, but the last connection back is already at 8 pm. Therefore, we consider to book a bus for all interested guests at your own cost back from Toline to Brescia with a potential stop in Iseo. Alternatively, the bus could also be booked in both directions. Please let us know in your RSVP if you are interested.
