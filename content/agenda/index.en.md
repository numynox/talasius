## Morning activities

If you are up for an acitivity in the morning before the wedding, we recommend a short trip with the [boat from Sulzano to Peschiera Maraglio](https://navigazionelagoiseo.it/en/) on Monte Isola, the island located in the middle of the lake. You can enjoy a walk along the coast or a coffee in one of the restaurants. For that, you should plan about 2 hours. The boat [leaves every 20min](https://navigazionelagoiseo.it/orari/Sulzano.pdf) and tickets can be bought at the counter close the pier.
