## Lake Iseo

![Corna Trentapassi](img/iseo/view8.jpg "View from Corna Trentapassi to Monte Isola")

### Corna Trentapassi

{{< hike-badges start="Zone" distance="40min" duration="3.5h" ascent="600m" gpx="corna-trentapassi.gpx" >}}


For the best view of Lake Iseo, you absolutely must go up **Corna Trentapassi**. It's a steep climb, but believe us, the 360-degree panorama from the summit is absolutely worth it. You have the whole lake and Monte Isola laid out before you. Plus, you can see our wedding venue from above. The southern part of the circular hike leads along an exposed path. If this is not for you, the northern part can also be taken on the way there and back.

> [!TIP] Tip
> You can combine this hike with a walk to the [Piramidi di Zone](../iseo#piramidi-di-zone).

### Monte Guglielmo

{{< hike-badges start="Croce di Marone" distance="60min" duration="5h" ascent="800m" gpx="guglielmo.gpx" >}}


The giant of the lake. **Monte Guglielmo** (or "Gölem", as the locals say) is a long but rewarding hike. On clear days you can see as far as the Apennines.

### Punta Almana

{{< hike-badges start="Portole" distance="45min" duration="5h" ascent="900m" gpx="punta-almana.gpx" >}}


A fantastic ridge walk. **Punta Almana** offers spectacular views of the lake and surrounding mountains. We particularly like the path via Forcella di Sale starting from Portole. Along the ridge you will see so-called _Roccoli_, structures built by locals to lure songbirds -- and grill them during a _spiedo_, after shooting them.

### Monte Rodondone

{{< hike-badges start="Santa Maria del Giogo" distance="40min" duration="3.5h" ascent="500m" gpx="monte-rodondone.gpx" >}}

A shorter and slightly less strenuous alternative to Punta Almana is to walk along the ridge south of it, past Monte Rodondone. Take a car along a narrow road to the Santuario Santa Maria del Giogo, where the hike begins. Compared to Punta Almana, you will find many more roccoli (see picture on Wikiloc). If you still have energy left, you can still climb Punta Almana from Croce di Pezzolo.

### Monte Isola

{{< hike-badges start="Peschiera Maraglio" distance="30min" duration="3-4h" ascent="450m" gpx="monte-isola.gpx" >}}

A simple, partly steep but rewarding hike to the summit of Monte Isola in the middle of Lake Iseo. There is a small church there, from which you can look at the peaks surrounding the lake. You can find [more information on the ferry here](../iseo/#monte-isola).

## Lake Garda

### Monte Cas

{{< hike-badges start="Campione | Tignale" distance="60min" duration="6.5h | 3h" ascent="1000m | 300m" gpx="monte-cas.gpx" >}}


**Monte Cas** offers a plunging view of the Montecastello sanctuary and the lake deep below. It feels like you are flying over the water. Near the summit, you can walk through tunnels from World War I defense fortifications. We started directly at the lake in Campione del Garda and descended after a rewarding detour via Cadignano. A much easier variant starts in Tignale to the sanctuary and leads back to the starting point via Prabione after the summit.

### Monte Bestone & Tremosine sul Garda

{{< hike-badges start="Tremosine (Campi)" distance="80min" duration="5.5h" ascent="500m" gpx="tremosine.gpx" >}}


The hike to **Monte Bestone** starts in the hamlet of Campi and leads moderately uphill to one of the most beautiful viewpoints over Lake Garda. From the summit with its characteristic bell, you can enjoy a spectacular panorama of Monte Baldo and the deep blue water. As a perfect ending, we recommend a stop in the mountain village of Tremosine sul Garda at the Terrazza del Brivido in the Pieve district on the way back.

The hike can be combined on the way there with a drive through the narrow Brasa Gorge ([Strada della Forra](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m7yFYnMUKNr3hJ1N6)). A car chase from the James Bond film "Quantum of Solace" was filmed here. Driving is only allowed uphill.

### Cima Comer & Eremo San Valentino

{{< hike-badges start="Briano" distance="80min" duration="4h" ascent="600m" gpx="cima-comer.gpx" >}}


For a great balcony over the lake, climb **Cima Comer** starting from the hiking parking near Briano. It is located near Gargnano and offers you a fantastic vantage point over the southern part of Lake Garda. The tour can be combined with a descent to Eremo San Valentino, a small monastery built directly into the rock face.

### Punta Larici

{{< hike-badges start="Pregasina" distance="90min" duration="5h" ascent="800m" gpx="punta-larici.gpx" >}}


The hike to **Punta Larici** starts in the tranquil mountain village of Pregasina, which sits high above Lake Garda. From there, a well-maintained, steadily ascending path leads through shady forest sections and Mediterranean vegetation. We took the more exposed path along the ridge instead. Shortly before the end of the forest road you come to Punta Larici: a rocky outcrop that offers one of the most spectacular panoramic views of the region: deep blue water glittering vertically below you, and an unobstructed view of Limone sul Garda and the Monte Baldo massif opposite.

## North of Brescia

![Ferrata Sasse](img/other/idro.jpg "The Ferrata Sasse above Lake Idro")

### Monte Maddalena

{{< hike-badges start="Monte Maddalena" distance="20min" duration="2h" ascent="150m" gpx="monte-maddalena.gpx" >}}

The Via Panoramica climbs directly from Brescia in 13 hairpin bends up to **Monte Maddalena**, gaining nearly 700 meters of elevation. Alternatively, you can take bus line 6. From the summit you can enjoy a pleasant circular hike or just a short stroll, and on clear days you can see as far as Lake Garda to the east and Monte Rosa to the west. You also get a direct view of the marble works of Botticino.

### Ferrata Sasse

{{< hike-badges start="Baitoni on Lake Idro" distance="70min" duration="4h" ascent="250m" gpx="ferrata-sasse.gpx" >}}


A well-maintained **via ferrata** directly along the shore of Lake Idro. The return path leads back through the forest with some elevation gain. The highlight is a rope bridge over the water. Equipment for the via ferrata can be rented at the campground near the start.

### Corna Blacca

{{< hike-badges start="Maniva" distance="60min" duration="5h" ascent="500m" gpx="corna-blacca.gpx" >}}


A simple but long hike starting from the Maniva ski area to Corna Blacca.

{{< wikiloc id="244035681" >}}

### Valle d'Inzino

{{< hike-badges start="Inzino" distance="30min" duration="5h" ascent="800m" gpx="valle-dinzino.gpx" >}}


A hike that is particularly recommended in high summer through the shady valley of Inzino up to Croce di Marone, where the hike to Monte Guglielmo also begins.
