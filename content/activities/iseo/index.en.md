Less known than Lake Garda, but at least as beautiful, Lake Iseo lies in the northwest of Brescia. Find out here what the lake has to offer on its shores.

## Monte Isola

Monte Isola is one of the largest lake islands in Europe and offers a wonderful atmosphere for exploring by bike or on foot. You can easily reach the island by [boat from Sulzano to Peschiera Maraglio](https://navigazionelagoiseo.it/en/). You can enjoy a walk along the coast or a coffee in one of the restaurants. The boat [runs every 20 minutes](https://navigazionelagoiseo.it/orari/Sulzano.pdf) and tickets can be bought at the counter near the pier. And if you have a little more time, you can also [hike to the church on the summit of Monte Isola](../hikes/#monte-isola).

## The Floating Piers
In 2016, the artist Christo created **The Floating Piers**, a temporary installation that allowed people to walk on water from Sulzano to Monte Isola and the island of San Paolo. Although the installation is gone, the event put Lake Iseo on the world map. If you take the same route by boat today, you get a sense of the scale of the project.

## Piramidi di Zone
For something truly unique, visit the **Piramidi di Zone**. These are massive earth pillars topped with large boulders, created by erosion. They look like something straight out of a fantasy movie. There is a well-marked circular trail that takes you through the reserve, offering various observation points to admire these geological giants. The path takes about 2 hours and starts at [Il Chiosco south of Zone](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FzSxnvpyEn2JfpreA), where you can also buy a ticket to visit the Piramidi di Zone.

## Riva

The famous **Riva boats** originated on Lake Iseo. In Sarnico, these elegant wooden boats, considered the epitome of luxury and Italian design, are still manufactured today.

## Valcamonica

North of the lake stretches the **Valcamonica**, known for its prehistoric rock engravings. This UNESCO World Heritage site is home to thousands of engravings dating back up to 8000 years, offering a fascinating glimpse into the lives of our ancestors.
