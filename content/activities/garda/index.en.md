Lake Garda is huge and has an incredible amount to offer. Here are our top activities for a day trip.

## Sirmione

The pearl of the lake. **Sirmione** is a stunning peninsula jutting into the water. Even the entrance to the town is like a fairytale: The Scaliger Castle guards the only access point with its battlements and towers.

The **Grotte di Catullo** is located at the very tip of the peninsula. These impressive ruins of a Roman villa are a highlight. The Romans used the hot thermal water emerging near Sirmione for their baths. The views over the turquoise water from up there are simply incredible and bring history to life.

## Gardone Riviera

In Gardone Riviera, a visit to the **Vittoriale degli Italiani**, the former home of the eccentric poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, is worthwhile. The estate is a curious mix of buildings, gardens, and an amphitheater that gives a fascinating insight into the artist's life.

Also in Gardone is the **André Heller Botanical Garden**. In this magical garden, artworks from all over the world get mixed with lush plant variety. It is a place of peace and inspiration that invites you to linger.

## Rocca di Manerba

For nature and history lovers among you, the **Rocca di Manerba** is a must. The park is a protected nature reserve with many paths leading up to the ruins of a medieval fortress on a cliff.

The climb is rewarded: The summit offers a beautiful panoramic view of the lower lake and its islands. On clear days, the view extends far across the water to the mountains on the other shore.

## Bike ride from Limone sul Garda

A real highlight for cyclists and walkers is the 2.5km long **Ciclopista del Garda** near Limone. This spectacular cycle and footpath was built directly onto the rock face and literally floats above the water.

The route offers breathtaking views and the feeling of floating over the lake. It is safe and also suitable for families, as it is separated from car traffic. An unforgettable experience, especially in the evening when the sun bathes the water in golden light.

## Boat trip

The best way to see the lake is definitely from the water. You can, for example, take a ferry from **Peschiera del Garda** to explore the southern shores and the massive fortress walls of the town from the water.

Alternatively, a trip from the elegant town of **Salò** is a good option. From here you can discover the west shore, known as the *Riviera dei Limoni*, with its historical villas and lemon gardens. The perspective from the boat reveals the true beauty and size of Lake Garda.
