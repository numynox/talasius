This project defines a wedding website informing guests about the key information of the wedding, the agenda, the place of the wedding and other activities. Guests will come from Italy, Germany and internationally.
The website is created using the hugo static site generator (https://gohugo.io) and the Blowfish theme (https://blowfish.page). It translates into English, German and Italian.
The main content is loacted in the content subdirectory. For each page there is a folder with three index files, one for each language (index.de.md, index.en.md, index.it.md). If the page contains children or is a listing, the files must be named _index.de.md, _index.en.md and _index.it.md.
